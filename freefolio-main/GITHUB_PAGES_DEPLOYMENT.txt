# COMPLETE GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## STEP 1: CREATE GITHUB ACCOUNT AND REPOSITORY

1. Go to https://github.com and create a free account (if you don't have one)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: Use your username for a personal site (e.g., "johnsmith.github.io") 
   OR any name for a project site (e.g., "my-portfolio")
5. Set to "Public" 
6. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## STEP 2: CONNECT YOUR LOCAL REPOSITORY

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Copy the HTTPS URL (looks like https://github.com/username/repository-name.git)

Then run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_URL_HERE
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## STEP 3: ENABLE GITHUB PAGES

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select "main" branch
6. Select "/ (root)" as folder
7. Click "Save"

## STEP 4: ACCESS YOUR LIVE SITE

After a few minutes, your site will be available at:
- Personal site: https://USERNAME.github.io
- Project site: https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME

## IMPORTANT NOTES:

- For a personal site, your repository MUST be named USERNAME.github.io
- For a project site, any name works
- Changes pushed to GitHub will automatically update your live site
- Your portfolio will be accessible at the GitHub Pages URL

## TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you get authentication errors:
1. Generate a personal access token in GitHub settings
2. Use it instead of password when pushing

If your site doesn't appear:
1. Check that you pushed to the correct branch (main)
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for initial deployment

Your site is now ready for deployment once you complete these steps!
